# MediClairfy-AI-Powered-Medicine-Information-API
MediClairfy is a backend-focused web application that provides reliable medicine information using a combination of FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, MySQL, and Generative AI. The system first checks locally stored medical data and, if unavailable, fetches information from trusted external sources and enhances it with AI-generated, user-friendly explanations.
